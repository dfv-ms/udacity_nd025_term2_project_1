# udacity_nd025_term2_project_1
That's my project 1 for Udacity's nanodegree "Data Science - Term 2"

As attendee I had to choose one dataset and do some data science analysis. 
I chose some data from the nfl, found at kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2015

I you want to run the analysis you have to clone the Jupyter Notebook onto your computer

and download the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2015#NFLPlaybyPlay2015.csv and put it into the subdirectory "data".
