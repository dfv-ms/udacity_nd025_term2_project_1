# udacity_nd025_term2_project_1
That's my project 1 for Udacity's nanodegree "Data Science - Term 2"

As attendee I had to choose one dataset and do some data science analysis. 
I chose some data from the NFL, found at kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2015

There is a medium blogpost at https://medium.com/@martin.stingl.dfv/will-my-team-get-a-first-down-right-now-c9c2bec61a81 about this analysis.

## Play-by-play data from the NFL

The data contains play-by-play data from the NFL season 2018. So I decided to look at questions like

* Can I predict if a team gets a first down given some data like down, field position, yards to go and time on clock?
* What's the probability to get a first down?
* Is there a dependancy to the team with the ball?

## Work on your own
I you want to run the analysis you have to clone the Jupyter Notebook onto your computer by

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dfv-ms/udacity_nd025_term2_project_1.git
```

and download the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2015#NFLPlaybyPlay2015.csv and put it into the subdirectory "data".
